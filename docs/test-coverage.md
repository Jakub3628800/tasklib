# TaskLib Test Coverage Analysis

## Overview

TaskLib has **two test suites** covering different aspects:

### Unit Tests (test_core.py)
- Decorator registration
- Configuration
- Exceptions
- ✅ **No database required** - fast, isolated

### Integration Tests (test_integration.py)
- Real PostgreSQL execution
- Worker loop behavior
- Multi-worker coordination
- ✅ **Comprehensive end-to-end testing**

---

## Unit Tests Coverage

### Task Decorator (`@task`)

✅ **Register Task**
- Simple function registration
- Task stored in global registry
- Can retrieve registered tasks

✅ **Decorator with Options**
- Custom max_retries
- Custom timeout_seconds
- Metadata properly stored

✅ **Duplicate Registration**
- Raises TaskAlreadyRegistered if same name used twice
- Prevents accidental overwrites

### Task Submission (`submit_task`)

✅ **Valid Submission**
- Task created in database
- UUID returned
- Proper defaults set

✅ **With Delay**
- scheduled_at calculated correctly
- Task not immediately ready

✅ **Unregistered Task**
- Raises TaskNotFound
- Prevents submitting non-decorated functions

✅ **Invalid Arguments**
- Type validation (caught at submit time)
- Missing required parameters (caught)

### Task Configuration

✅ **Config Defaults**
- max_retries = 3
- base_retry_delay_seconds = 5.0
- retry_backoff_multiplier = 2.0
- lock_timeout_seconds = 600

✅ **Custom Config**
- Can override all defaults
- Properly propagated to tasks

### Task Listing & Filtering

✅ **List All Tasks**
- Returns tasks from database

✅ **Filter by State**
- Filter pending, running, completed, failed

✅ **Filter by Name**
- Get all tasks for specific function

✅ **Limit Results**
- Respects limit parameter

---

## Integration Tests Coverage

### Basic Execution

✅ **Submit and Execute Simple Task**
- Task created
- Worker picks it up
- Executes function
- Stores result
- Task marked completed

✅ **Result Storage**
- Result stored as `{"value": return_value}`
- Can be retrieved via get_task()

### Delayed Execution

✅ **Delayed Task**
- scheduled_at set correctly in future
- Task not picked up until scheduled_at
- Executes at right time

### Task Configuration

✅ **Custom Retry Settings**
- max_retries overrideable per task
- timeout_seconds configurable

✅ **Priority Ordering**
- High-priority tasks execute first
- Ordering preserved in queue

### Pydantic Validation

✅ **Type Validation**
- Valid types accepted
- Invalid types rejected at submit
- Clear error messages

✅ **Type Coercion**
- Pydantic handles standard conversions
- Invalid conversions rejected

✅ **Missing Required Parameters**
- Rejected if required param missing
- Error at submit time, not execution

✅ **Optional Parameters**
- Defaults applied correctly
- Can omit optional params

### Failure Handling

✅ **Task Failure with Retry**
- Task executes and fails
- Automatically scheduled for retry
- retry_count incremented
- next_retry_at calculated (exponential backoff)
- Error traceback captured

✅ **Exponential Backoff**
- First retry: base_delay (5s)
- Second retry: base_delay * 2 (10s)
- Third retry: base_delay * 4 (20s)
- Formula: delay = base * (multiplier ^ attempt)

✅ **Max Retries Exceeded**
- Task stops retrying after max_retries
- Marked as permanently failed
- completed_at set
- Error stored for debugging

✅ **Task Timeout**
- Tasks exceeding timeout fail
- Timeout errors captured
- Can be retried

### Multi-Worker Scenarios

✅ **Multiple Workers Processing**
- Multiple workers concurrently execute tasks
- Each task picked up exactly once (SELECT FOR UPDATE)
- No duplicate execution
- Proper load distribution

### Locking & Coordination

✅ **SELECT FOR UPDATE Locking**
- Only one worker can claim a task
- Row-level PostgreSQL lock
- Atomic acquisition

✅ **Lock Timeout (Dead Worker Detection)**
- If worker dies, lock expires
- Other workers can pick up stale task
- locked_until timestamp prevents indefinite locks

### Task State Helpers

✅ **is_pending()**
- Correctly identifies pending tasks

✅ **is_running()**
- Correctly identifies running tasks

✅ **is_completed()**
- Correctly identifies completed tasks

✅ **is_failed()**
- Correctly identifies failed tasks

✅ **has_result()**
- True if result exists
- False if null

✅ **has_error()**
- True if error exists
- False if null

✅ **is_terminal()**
- Completed tasks are terminal
- Failed tasks with max_retries reached are terminal
- Other states are not terminal

### Monitoring & Querying

✅ **Get Single Task**
- Retrieve by UUID
- All fields populated correctly

✅ **List with Filters**
- Filter by state
- Filter by name
- Respect limit

✅ **Get Registered Tasks**
- Returns dict of all registered functions

## What Could Be Tested More

### 🟡 Edge Cases

- Unicode/special characters in parameters
- Null/None values in kwargs
- Empty functions (no parameters)

### 🟡 Concurrency Edge Cases
- Race conditions under extreme load
- Lock contention scenarios
- Network timeout during DB write
- Partial failure (task executed but DB write fails)

### 🟡 Worker Resilience
- Worker crash during execution (lock timeout recovery)
- Database connection loss during execution
- Poison pills (tasks that always fail)
- Memory leaks with many concurrent tasks

### 🟡 Performance Testing
- 10K+ concurrent tasks
- Very slow tasks (timeouts)
- Very fast tasks (1ms execution)
- Large batch submissions

## Coverage Gaps & Recommendations

### Recommended Additional Tests (Future)

1. **Poison Pill Tests**
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.asyncio
   async def test_task_that_corrupts_state(self, init_db):
       """Task that fails in weird ways"""
       @tasklib.task
       def corrupting_task():
           raise MemoryError("OOM")
       # Should still handle gracefully
   ```

2. **Large Payload Tests**
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.asyncio
   async def test_large_kwargs(self, init_db):
       """Submit task with 1MB of kwargs"""
       data = {"data": "x" * (1024 * 1024)}
       task_id = await tasklib.submit_task(large_task, **data)
       # Should serialize and deserialize correctly
   ```

3. **Stress Tests**
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.asyncio
   async def test_10k_concurrent_tasks(self, init_db):
       """Submit 10,000 tasks concurrently"""
       # Should handle without hitting limits
   ```

4. **Network Failure Simulation**
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.asyncio
   async def test_db_connection_lost_during_execution(self, init_db):
       """Worker loses DB connection mid-execution"""
       # Should gracefully reconnect or fail over
   ```

## Test Quality Metrics

### What We Measure
- ✅ Happy path (task succeeds)
- ✅ Error path (task fails and retries)
- ✅ Max retries (task fails permanently)
- ✅ Timeout (task takes too long)
- ✅ Validation (bad inputs rejected)
- ✅ Locking (atomic acquisition)
- ✅ Concurrency (multi-worker)

### What We Don't Measure (Yet)
- ❌ Memory usage under load
- ❌ CPU efficiency
- ❌ Network partition recovery
- ❌ PostgreSQL version compatibility
- ❌ Performance under extreme load

---

## Continuous Integration Ready

Tests are ready for CI/CD:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:15
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      - run: pip install uv
